# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Future Feature
- Associate snippet with an office
- Associate snippet with a project
- Share snippet to others/invite others to your snippet, so when there is a change, they can see it. Or if an office have a snippet, they could invite their employee to visit and maintain the snippet to other generation

- Multiple type: personal and space. space could include a few accounts, with hierarchical structure and restrictid access for the role

# Note
- Database (postgresQl through Supabase)
