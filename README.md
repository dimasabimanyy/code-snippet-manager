# Code Snippet Vault

## Future Feature
Currently i'm planning to add several new features to enhance the snippet management experience:

- Associate Snippets with Offices: Allow users to categorize snippets by office, making it easier to manage company-specific code.
- Associate Snippets with Projects: Link snippets to specific projects, helping teams maintain and organize reusable code in context.
- Snippet Sharing & Collaboration: Share snippets with others or invite teammates to collaborate. When a snippet is updated, everyone with access will be notified. Teams can maintain snippets together, ensuring consistency across generations of employees.
- VS Code Integration: Integration with Visual Studio Code to streamline workflows. Easily access and manage your snippets directly within the code editor.
- Multiple Snippet Types: Support for Personal and Space snippet types. A Space can include multiple accounts with hierarchical structures and restricted access for different roles.

Feel free to request any new feature!

## Note
- Database: The app uses PostgreSQL via Supabase for database management. Supabase provides a scalable backend solution to manage your snippets and user data.
